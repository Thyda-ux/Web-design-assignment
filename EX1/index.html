    <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the world of codes.</p>

    <p>Last year, millions of our learners started with HTML.</p>

    <p>Why?</p>
    <p><strong>HTML is the skeleton of all web pages.</strong> Itâ€™s often the first language learned by developers, marketers, and designers and is core to front-end development work.</p>
    <p>HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image" target="_blank">images</a>, text, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video" target="_blank">videos</a>.</p>
